If you want to provide a user-friendly experience without requiring users to deal with complex installation or configuration steps, you might consider creating an installer that includes all the necessary components, dependencies, and configurations. One way to achieve this is by using an installer tool such as Inno Setup.

Here's a simplified guide to using Inno Setup to create an installer for your Python application:

1. Install Inno Setup:
Download and install Inno Setup from the official website: Inno Setup Downloads.
2. Organize Your Project:
Ensure your project is well-organized with clear separation of code, resources, and other components.
3. Create a Virtual Environment:
Create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies.
4. Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary dependencies within the virtual environment.
5. Create a Requirements File:
Generate a requirements.txt file listing your Python dependencies.
6. Write an Inno Setup Script:
Create a script file (e.g., installer_script.iss) for Inno Setup. This script specifies how your application should be packaged into an installer.
Example Inno Setup Script:

pascal
Copy code
; Script generated by the Inno Setup Script Wizard.

[Setup]
AppName=YourAppName
AppVersion=1.0
DefaultDirName={pf}\YourAppName
DefaultGroupName=YourAppName
UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\YourAppName.exe
OutputDir=Output
Compression=lzma
SolidCompression=yes

[Files]
Source: "dist\*"; DestDir: "{app}"

[Icons]
Name: "{group}\YourAppName"; Filename: "{app}\YourAppName.exe"
Name: "{group}\Uninstall YourAppName"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"
Adjust the placeholders like YourAppName with your actual application name.

7. Compile the Installer:
Open the Inno Setup Compiler, and load your script file. Click "Compile" to generate the installer.
8. Distribute the Installer:
Distribute the generated installer to your users.
9. Installation Process:
Users can run the installer, which will guide them through the installation process. The installer will set up the application, including all necessary files and dependencies.
By using an installer, you provide users with a straightforward way to install and run your application without worrying about manual setup steps. Remember to test the installer on a clean machine to ensure it works as expected.
